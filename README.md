Question   1In   a   standard   deck   of   cards   there   are   4   suits:      clubs,   diamonds,    hearts    and   spades.       Each    suit   contains   13   cards:    2, 3, . . . , 10, J, Q,K,   A.    So   there   are   4   ·   13   =   52   cards,   in   the   deck.    A   poker   hand   is   a   5-card   subset   of   the   standard   deck   of   cards.
(a)    How   many   diferent   poker   hands   are   possible?       [3   marks]
(b)    How   many   poker   hands   contain   two   clubs,   two   diamonds   and   one   spade?        [3   marks]
(c)    How    many   poker   hands   contain   at   least   one   spade?           [3   marks][Question   1   Total:   9   marks]
Question   2
Consider   distributing   30   identical   balls   into   10   distinct   boxes   numbered   1; . . . ; 10.
(a)    In    how   many   ways   can   this   be   done?        [3   marks]
(b)    What   is   the   number   of   such   distributions   in   which   odd   numbered   boxes   are   nonempty?        [3   marks]
(c)    What is the   number of such distributions in which the   number of balls that each   box   receives   is   a   multiple   of 3?    (So we   are   interested   in   distributions   in which   for   every   i   ∈   {1; . . . ; 10},   there   exists   a   nonnegative   integer   ki      such   that   the   number   of   balls   that   box   i   receives   is   3ki.)        代 写COMP151101 Introduction to Discrete Mathematics Semester 2 2018/2019SQL

Question   3
(a)    What   is   the   coefficient   of   x2y3    when   the   expression   (3x   - 2y)5      is   expanded?           [3   marks]
(b)    What   is   the   coefficient   of   x5y3    when   the   expression   (x + y   + 2)10      is   expanded?        [3   marks][Question   3   Total:   6   marks]
Question   4
Three   coins   are   tossed:    a   5p   coin,   a    10p   coin   and   a   20p   coin.    Let    A   be   the   event   that   an   odd   number   of tails   appear.    Let   B    be   the   event   that   at   least   two   heads   appear.
(a)   What   is   the   probability   of   A?        [3   marks]
(b)   What   is   the   probability   of   B?        [3   marks]
(c)   What   is   the   probability   of   A ∩ B?        [3   marks]
(d)    Are   the   events   A   and   B   independent?    (You   must justify   your   answer!)        [3   marks][Question   4   Total:   12   marks]
Question   5
(a)    Deﬁne   the   following:
•    a   path   of length   n   (where   n   is   a   nonnegative   integer);
•   a   cycle;
•    a   simple   cycle.               [6   marks]
(b)    Prove   that   every   odd   closed   path   C   contains   an   odd   simple   cycle.   (Hint:    use   induction   on   the   length   l   of   C.)           [6   marks]
